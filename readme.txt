In package.json, the tilde (~) allows for updates to the latest patch version (e.g., ~1.2.3 allows 1.2.4 but not 1.3.0), while the caret (^) allows for updates to the latest minor and patch versions within the same major version (e.g., ^1.2.3 allows 1.3.0 and 1.3.4 but not 2.0.0). The caret provides more flexibility for adopting new features, while the tilde provides tighter version control for maximum stability and bug fixes.
